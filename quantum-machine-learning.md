# COSC 794: Quantum Machine Learning

This graduate-level course provides an introduction to the foundations and practical aspects of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The course aims to equip students with both the theoretical background and hands-on experience necessary to understand and explore the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.

## Course Abstract

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and data-driven artificial intelligence. This course introduces the fundamental principles of quantum computing and explores how quantum mechanics can be harnessed to develop new machine learning algorithms. We will cover essential quantum algorithms, mathematical foundations such as vector spaces and complex numbers, and examine recent advances in QML applications.

Students will gain hands-on experience with quantum programming frameworks and apply quantum concepts to implement simple machine learning models.
