**Omar Alhussein**  
Assistant Professor, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE

I am currently an assistant professor with the computer science department at Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates. Prior to joining Khalifa University, I have worked as a senior research engineer with the advanced networking team at Huawei Technologies Canada, Ottawa, Canada, from 2020 to 2023.

I received my Ph.D. degree with the [BBCR lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/broadband-communications-research-lab/) at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. [Weihua Zhuang](https://bbcr.uwaterloo.ca/~wzhuang/). My [thesis](research_phd.html) focuses on the orchestration and provisioning of network function virtualization enabled multicast services.

I received my MASc degree from Simon Fraser University under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Liang](https://www.sfu.ca/~jiel/) and Prof. [Sami Muhaidat](https://sites.google.com/view/muhaidat/home?authuser=0). My [thesis](research_masc.html) is on the performance analysis of generalized and composite wireless fading channels through the use of mixture distributions.

Please feel free to contact me for anything.
